# SAS Macro Case Study

Wednesday, 9/24
10:00AM - 11:30AM

Learn SAS macro techniques through a step-by-step case study. Starting with a base program containing PROC SQL and PROC SGPLOT steps, the program is transformed into a macro definition that accepts parameters for flexibility and reuse.

Along the way, learn how to create data-driven macro variables, use DO loops with indirect references to generate multiple PDFs with dynamic filters and titles, validate inputs with conditional processing and leverage autocall macros for reusable automation. %PUT statements are used throughout to verify results and aid in debugging, giving you practical strategies to apply in your own projects.
